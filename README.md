Mouse Tracker
This simple JavaScript code tracks the mouse cursor on the webpage and creates a colored dot at the current mouse position. The color of the dot changes randomly on each movement.

How it Works
•	When the mouse moves, a mousemove event is triggered on the document.body.
•	The myFunction function is called in response to the mousemove event. This function creates a colored dot element at the current 

mouse position.
•	The getRandomColor function generates a random color for the dot using hexadecimal values.
•	The displayHello function removes the dot from the DOM every second using setInterval.

Usage
1.	Simply include the JavaScript code in your HTML file or link it externally.
2.	Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3.	Move your mouse cursor around the webpage to see the colored dot follow your movements.
